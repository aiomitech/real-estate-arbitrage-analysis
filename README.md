# Real Estate Arbitrage Analysis

## Description
This beginner-friendly project introduces data science and Python programming through real-world applications in the real estate industry. The project focuses on identifying arbitrage opportunities by analyzing rental data across neighborhoods and calculating potential profits.

## Features
- Use Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
- Explore and preprocess a sample real estate dataset.
- Perform data analysis to uncover arbitrage opportunities.
- Visualize insights through simple and effective plots.
- Gain hands-on experience with basic real estate arbitrage concepts.

## Objectives
- Understand the concept of real estate arbitrage and its application to rental properties.
- Practice data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization techniques using Python.
- Calculate arbitrage potential for properties based on dataset features.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
