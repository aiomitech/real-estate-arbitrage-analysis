# Real Estate Arbitrage Concepts

Real estate arbitrage is an investment strategy where individuals or entities capitalize on price or value differences in the real estate market to generate profits. This approach involves leveraging variations in rent, property prices, market demand, or operational efficiencies between two or more locations or platforms. The fundamental principle is buying, leasing, or controlling a property at a lower cost and then using it in a way that earns a higher return.

## Categories of Real Estate Arbitrage

1. House Flipping - House flipping is a simple concept to understand. You buy an outdated, sometimes unlivable house, and renovate it up to modern standards. Your work, often called “sweat equity,” is what makes the home shine, and what allows you to walk away with a profit.
2. Wholesaling - Wholesaling (in real estate at least) is a term only investors use. Think of wholesalers as the deal finders for flippers. Wholesalers find under-valued properties and send them to flippers while charging a finders fee. They can save flippers a TON of time. In fact, I used a wholesaler to buy my most recent purchase, a self-storage facility!
3. Master Leasing - If you’ve got the skills, but no money, for real estate investing, then the master lease is for you! A master lease is a lease that gives you, the tenant, almost all the same rights as the owner, and often comes with the option for you to buy the property at a future date. Why would you use a master lease? A few scenarios would be that a property isn’t financeable yet, a seller wants a steady stream of income instead of a large lump sum, or you simply want to make money off of someone else’s property.
4. Rental Arbitrage - Rental arbitrage is a strategy almost too simple to pass up. You rent out a property and then sublease it out on short-term and mid-term rental sites like Airbnb and VRBO. You must get the landlord’s permission before doing this, but it can be an incredibly lucrative way to make passive income without owning a single property.

## Risks

- Legal Constraints: Some strategies like wholesaling and Rental arbitrage come with a minefield of legal problems. Our advice: talk to an attorney before you start.
- Additional Expenses: Maintaining leased properties, flipping homes, and building a wholesaler team does require some added expenses.
- No Equity Upside: For all the above strategies except for flipping, you fail to actualize any equity in your deals!

## Tips to Start Real Estate Arbitraging

Now that you have the basics of real estate arbitrage, it’s time to put them into action. Here are some tips on how to get started:

**Pick Your Strategy**
This is the most important step. You need to identify which strategy fits your goals and risk tolerance level. Find one that interests you and works with your skill set, access to capital, and schedule!

**Form an LLC**
It’s important to have an LLC set up for real estate arbitrage. It provides you with limited liability protection in case something goes wrong with your deals. You can also use it to hold multiple properties, which is a great way to diversify your portfolio and create a layer of asset protection.

**Find a Market**
The next step is to find a market that has profit potential. You can do this by looking at the home prices, vacancy rates, and other economic factors within the area. You can also check out local real estate blogs that focus on your market to see what types of properties are selling/renting well—and which ones aren’t at all! Use tools like AirDNA or Realtor to do this market research. Or, if you’re interested in Airbnb arbitrage, check out our best cities for rental arbitrage list!

**Run the Numbers**
Once you’ve found a market that has potential, it’s time to run the numbers. You can do this by looking at the current home prices, rental rates, and nightly rates within your target area. Then, calculate how much profit (or loss) you could make if you were to invest in that particular market.
